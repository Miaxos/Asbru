# Extensions

/!\ This part is not working right now /!\

Inside the configuration file, you can also define which extensions should be used and how. `Asbru` provides out of the box several extensions implementations to allow you to create a powerfull GraphQL API.

## Apollo Studio

Apollo studio is an Apollo Service which allow you to add an observability tool to your GraphQL API.

`async-graphql` has an extension to create & send your graphql metrics to Apollo Studio: [async_graphql_apollo_studio_extension](https://github.com/async-graphql/async_graphql_apollo_studio_extension).
