# Introduction

`Asbru` is an `async_graphql` Data-oriented Service Mesh generator: it'll generate an `async_graphql` project from a schema with resolvers, dataloaders, data-transformation. It'll create a Data-oriented service mesh from your schema so you'll just have to describe your microservices with your described schema to have a Data-Oriented Service Mesh like Airbnb's.

It aims to be fully compatible with the Relay GraphQL specification and most of its extensions and offers type safety and high performance thanks to the `async-graphql` crates.
