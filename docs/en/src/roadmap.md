# Roadmap

The `Asbru` Roadmap, no deadlines are indicated because it's an open-source project where I don't get paid to work on it.

## 0.1.0 Release

The 0.1.0 release aims to provide a working GraphQL Gateway with `Queries` and `Connections`. No caching strategy are expected. The whole point for this release is to create a main structure to iterate.

## 1.0.0 Release

The 1.0.0 Release aims to provide a working Data-Oriented Service Mesh usable from the entreprise to the solo dev prototyping an application.
